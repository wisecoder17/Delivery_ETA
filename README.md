## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end delivery time prediction pipeline using real-world logistics data.  
It covers **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, model selection, and production-ready inference**.

**Objective:** Predict delivery duration (in minutes) based on distance, traffic conditions, temporal factors, and weather.

---

## Problem Statement

Accurate delivery time estimation is critical for:  

- Optimizing customer experience  
- Supporting operational planning  
- Improving logistics and fleet efficiency  

Delivery time is influenced by non-linear, interacting factors, making it a **regression problem** best addressed with ensemble learning.

---

## Dataset

**Primary dataset:** Amazon Delivery Dataset (~43,000 rows)

**Contains:**  

- Store & drop-off coordinates  
- Order timestamps  
- Traffic conditions  
- Weather categories  
- Actual delivery time (target variable)

**Data Provenance:** Publicly available; preprocessed chronologically to prevent data leakage.

## Feature Engineering

<details>
<summary>Click to expand engineered features</summary>

| Feature        | Description                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| distance_km    | Haversine distance between store and drop-off location |
| hour           | Hour of day extracted from order timestamp         |
| day_of_week    | Integer-encoded weekday (0–6)                      |
| is_weekend     | Binary weekend indicator                            |
| traffic_level  | Ordinal traffic encoding (Low → Jam)               |
| weather        | One-hot encoded categorical feature                |

**Consistency:** All transformations applied during training are reused during inference.

## Modeling Strategy

**Models Trained:**  

- Linear Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost (**Selected Best Model**)  

**Evaluation Metrics:**  

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – primary  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score  

**Selection Criterion:** Lowest test MAE for operational relevance.

## Results Summary

| Model             | MAE                     | RMSE         | R²  |
|------------------|------------------------|--------------|-----|
| Linear Regression | High                   | High         | Low |
| KNN               | Moderate               | Moderate     | Low |
| Random Forest     | Overfitting observed   | Unstable     | Low |
| XGBoost           | Best                   | Best         | 0.33 |

**Key Insight:** XGBoost captures non-linear interactions between traffic, time, and distance and generalizes best.

Usage

Command-Line Interface
```
python src/predict.py
```
Programmatic API
```
from src.predict import predict_delivery_time

predict_delivery_time(
    distance_km=12.5,
    hour=16,
    day_of_week=4,
    weather="Sunny",
    traffic_level="High",
    is_weekend=1
)
```
Features:
	•	Computes distance if only coordinates are provided
	•	Normalizes categorical inputs
	•	Applies same encoders as used during training

⸻

Key Insights
	•	Traffic level is the strongest predictor
	•	Temporal features (hour, weekday) influence delivery time
	•	Distance alone is insufficient; contextual features are essential
	•	Ensemble models outperform linear baselines
	•	Model and encoders are serialized; inference logic decoupled from training
	•	All plots and tables are stored under results/

⸻

Future Improvements
	•	Residual and error distribution analysis
	•	Integration of real-time traffic data
	•	API deployment (FastAPI)
	•	Continuous retraining with additional datasets
